    <h3>Transfer of Your Personal Data</h3>
    <p>Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other
      places where the parties involved in the processing are located. It means that this information may be transferred

      jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from Your jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such information represents Your agreement to
      that transfer.</p>
    <p>The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and in
      accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a
      country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your data and other personal
      information.</p>

    <h3>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h3>
    <h4>Business Transactions</h4>

      protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
      information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has
      provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from
      anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from
      Our servers.</p>
    <p>If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country requires consent
      from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information.</p>
